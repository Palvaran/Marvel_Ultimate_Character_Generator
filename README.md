# Marvel_Ultimate_Character_Generator

The purpose of this Github is to document the progress of replicating the character generator from the Marvel Super Heroes RPG from 1986.  Additionally, this program incorporates the updates and addendas from the Ultimate Powers Guide. Originally, I wanted to start learning Python in a way that I could actually see the results in a way that was more personalized to my interests in Marvel Comics. From here, I will then link the Python project into Wordpress on my AWS LightSail Wordpress site at ideasquantified.com.
